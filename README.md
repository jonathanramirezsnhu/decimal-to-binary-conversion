# decimal-to-binary-conversion
This is a simple program that converts a number into binary. In the future, I will be expanding the program to add features such as testing by adding use cases, parameter checking
and checking the user enters correct value if not prompt the user to keep trying until a correct value is entered.

**Note:** I will be using jupyter notebook
